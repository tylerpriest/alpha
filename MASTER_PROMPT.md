# MASTER PROMPT: Build a Profitable B2B Product from Scratch

## Context
You are a solo founder or tiny team with:
- Technical skills (can build software)
- Zero customers
- Zero revenue
- Limited runway (need to validate fast)
- Access to AI tools (OpenAI, etc.)

Your goal: Build something people will pay for in 4 weeks.

---

## PART 1: WHAT NOT TO BUILD

### Avoid These Patterns:

1. **"AI Knowledge Base"** - Generic, Notion exists, no differentiation
2. **"Platform for X"** - Requires network effects before value
3. **Competing with well-funded players** - Hebbia ($700M), AlphaSense, etc.
4. **Small TAM** - VCs = only 4,500 firms in US, too niche
5. **Enterprise sales** - 6-12 month cycles, you'll run out of money
6. **Freemium models** - 1-2% conversion, need massive volume
7. **"Pitch deck generator"** - Free tools exist (Wordware)
8. **Anything requiring data moats** - PitchBook, Crunchbase have 20+ years

### Red Flags:
- "Would you pay for this?" → Yes, but they won't
- "This would save me time" → But not enough to pay
- "Nobody does this well" → Maybe nobody wants it
- "I need to build more features first" → No, you need customers

---

## PART 2: WHAT TO BUILD INSTEAD

### The Formula That Works:

```
NARROW NICHE + SPECIFIC PROBLEM + OUTCOME-BASED PRICING = Revenue
```

### Success Metrics (Micro SaaS Benchmarks):
- **$15K MRR** median for successful micro SaaS
- **85% profit margins** typical
- **1-2 people** team size
- **<$1,000** to start
- **3-6 months** to profitability
- **40%+ built with no-code** in 2024

### What Actually Works:

| Pattern | Example | Why It Works |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Productized Service** | "$500 market maps" | Easier to sell than software |
| **Outcome-Based** | "$99 per IC memo" | Pay for results, not seats |
| **Vertical SaaS** | "CRM for Landscapers" | Deep niche, high switching costs |
| **Boring Industries** | Compliance, invoicing | "Unsexy, underserved" wins |
| **SMB Focus** | Small businesses | Faster sales, more customers |

## PART 4: THE 4-WEEK VALIDATION PLAYBOOK

### Week 1: Pick & Build Landing Page

**Day 1-2: Pick ONE from the list above**
- Choose based on your domain knowledge
- Prefer Tier 1 opportunities
- Pick something you could deliver manually

**Day 3-4: Build landing page**
- Clear value prop: "We [outcome] for [audience]"

- Message: "I help [audience] with [problem]. Would you pay $X for [outcome]?"
- Don't ask for calls - ask for money

**Day 11-14: Close first sale**

## PART 6: MARKETS TO TARGET (Ranked by Opportunity)

### Best Markets for Solo Founders:

| Market | Size | Why It's Good | Entry Point |
|--------|------|---------------|-------------|
| **Small Accounting Firms** | 46,000 | 41% CAGR in AI adoption | Client updates |
| **Trades (HVAC/Plumbing)** | Millions | "First AI adopters" | Invoicing |
| **Small Gov Contractors** | Thousands | 23% of federal $$ | RFP responses |
| **Marketing Agencies** | 60,000+ | High margins, pay for tools | Proposals |
| **Small Staffing Agencies** | 25,000+ | 50% time savings proven | Screening |
| **Insurance Agencies** | 38,000 | 6.1x returns for AI leaders | Quote comparison |
| **Small Law Firms** | 450,000 | Harvey raised $300M | Contract review |
| **Funded Startups** | 500,000+ | Have budget, need help | Board decks |

### Avoid These Markets:
- VCs (too small, too sophisticated)
- Enterprise (too slow, too political)
- Consumer (too crowded, too cheap)
- Crypto (too volatile)
- Healthcare (too regulated for speed)

---

## PART 7: PRICING GUIDELINES

### Don't Price Based on:
- How long it took you to build
- What competitors charge
- What you think is "fair"

### Price Based on:
- Value delivered to customer
- Time saved × hourly rate
- Alternative cost (doing it themselves)

### Pricing Rules:

1. **Charge 10x your cost** - If AI costs $0.10, charge $1
2. **Start high, discount down** - Easier than raising later
3. **Per-deliverable > per-seat** - Outcome alignment
4. **Anchor high** - Show "enterprise" tier at $500/mo, sell $99/mo tier

### Example Pricing:
- RFP response: $500 (saves 20 hours × $50/hr = $1,000 value)
- Board deck: $99 (saves 5 hours × $100/hr = $500 value)
- Invoice automation: $49/mo (saves 30 hrs/mo × $30/hr = $900 value)

## PART 11: KEY MENTAL MODELS

### 1. "Software is the means. Service is the wedge."
Don't sell software. Sell the outcome. Use software to deliver it faster.

### 2. "Boring is beautiful."
The sexiest opportunities are in the least sexy industries. Compliance, invoicing, reporting.

### 3. "Charge for deliverables, not access."
$500/proposal > $50/month subscription. Outcome-based wins.

### 4. "Narrow is wide."
"CRM for landscapers" beats "CRM for SMBs". Narrow = easier to find, sell to, and dominate.

### 5. "Money exchanged is the only validation."
Surveys lie. "Would you pay?" lies. Actual payments = truth.

### 6. "Build the smallest thing that proves the thesis."
Not MVP (minimum viable product). MLP (minimum lovable payment).

### 7. "Your first product is probably wrong."
Plan to pivot. The first customer teaches you what to really build.

## PART 12: THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS

1. **Nobody cares about your product** - They care about their problems
2. **You're not special** - Someone else had this idea already
3. **Features don't matter** - Results do
4. **VC money is a drug** - Bootstrap if you can
5. **Your code quality is irrelevant** - Customer satisfaction is everything
6. **Speed > Perfection** - Ship ugly, iterate fast
7. **Most advice is wrong** - Including this. Test everything.

---

## PART 13: THE ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY

> **Find a boring problem in a large market, solve it manually for $500, then automate.**

That's it. Everything else is details.

## APPENDIX B: ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS FROM RESEARCH

### On AI Wrappers:
> "If OpenAI shut down your API key and your startup also dies, you didn't build a product — you built a fancy prompt."

**But successful wrappers exist:**
- Cursor: $500M revenue, founded 2022
- Granola: $20M raised, 5,000 weekly users after 6 months
- Read AI: 720% user growth, 100,000 new accounts/week

**The difference**: They have deep vertical integration, not just prompts.

### On Spreadsheet Replacement:

**Opportunity**: Build vertical spreadsheet replacements
- "CRM for X" beats "CRM"
- "Airtable for Law Firms" beats "Airtable"

### On Meeting Notes Market:

1. **Data** - Aggregate proprietary data over time
2. **Vertical Integration** - Deep workflow embedding
3. **Domain Expertise** - Understand the user's world
4. **Human Layer** - Trust through human-in-the-loop
5. **Network Effects** - User value increases with more users

### Final Wisdom:
> "Boring is beautiful. The sexiest opportunities are in the least sexy industries."

> "Money exchanged is the only validation. Surveys lie."

> "Your first product is probably wrong. Plan to pivot."
