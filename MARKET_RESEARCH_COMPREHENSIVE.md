# AlphaIntel Market Research: What VCs Actually Pay For
## Comprehensive Web Research - December 2025

---

## Executive Summary

After 50+ web searches, the research reveals a **massive opportunity** but also **brutal competitive reality**. VCs are underserved by purpose-built software, but incumbents are well-funded and consolidating.

### The Brutal Truth (Ralph Wiggum Style)
- VCs evaluate 101 deals for every 1 investment (<1% close rate)
- They spend just 6 minutes on initial screening
- 95% use software that's NOT "built for purpose"
- Founder NPS for VCs is only 23 (below airline industry!)
- But: Hebbia is valued at $700M on $13M revenue. DealCloud costs $505k/year average.

---

## Part 4: What VCs Wish Existed

### The Gap Statement
> "95% of VCs use software that's not 'built-for-purpose'"

### Specific Unmet Needs

1. **Purpose-Built VC CRM**
   - Semil Shah (Haystack): "Larger VC firms need to invest the time and money to build their own CRMs and databases, as existing solutions don't do it"
   - Y Combinator built Bookface; others want similar

2. **Automated IC Memo Generation**
   - Currently manual, takes days
   - "Slow, repetitive, prone to inconsistencies"

3. **Market Map Automation**
   - Junior VCs spend "days or weeks" on landscape docs
   - Quickly become obsolete

4. **Anti-Portfolio Tracking**
   - Learning from missed deals
   - Pattern recognition across passes

5. **Institutional Memory**
   - "Have we seen this company before?"
   - Knowledge doesn't leave when partners do

6. **Better LP Reporting**
   - Automated data collection
   - Branded, professional reports
   - Not "buried in spreadsheets"

## Part 5: Competitive Landscape Analysis

### Document AI (Hebbia's Space)
| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| **Hebbia** ($700M valuation) | 92% accuracy, 30% of asset managers | Expensive ($10-15k+), learning curve, not for teams |
| **AlphaSense** | Large content library, acquisitions | "Keeps acquiring competitors and gutting products," steep learning curve |
| **V7 Go** | VC-specific agents (TAM analysis, cap tables) | Newer player |

### VC CRM
| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| **Affinity** | Auto-captures relationships, VC-focused | ~$2,700/user/year |
| **4Degrees** | Relationship intelligence | Custom pricing |
| **Attio** | Modern, flexible, cheaper ($29-119/mo) | Less VC-specific features |

### Deal Sourcing
| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| **Grata** (merged with SourceScrub) | 19M+ companies, owned by Datasite | Pricing not public |
| **Harmonic** | Early signal detection, founder tracking | Pricing not public |

## Part 6: VCs Who Built Their Own Tools

### The Pattern: Top Firms Build In-House

| Firm | Tool | What It Does |
|------|------|--------------|
| **EQT Ventures** | Motherbrain (since 2016) | AI deal sourcing platform |
| **Kleiner Perkins** | Dragnet (since 2010) | Ingests tweets, app store data, AngelList |
| **Correlation Ventures** | Proprietary database | 20 years of VC data, 2-day decisions |
| **Tribe Capital** | Termina | Data science spinout |
| **Hof Capital** | Proprietary tool | Pre-screening based on founder backgrounds |
| **Hoxton Ventures** | Custom front-end | Live sourcing feed |

### What This Means
- Top firms believe **data is a moat**
- Off-the-shelf tools don't meet their needs
- Emerging managers want similar but can't afford to build

---

- **70%** - Sourcing and evaluation
- **20%** - Portfolio companies
- **10%** - Fundraising

### Deal Flow Volume

- Large VC firms: **200+** inbound pitches/week
- **<1% close rate** (101 deals evaluated per investment)

### Software Budget
- **$3.8k/seat/year** for data sources alone
- **$1.2k/seat/year** for basic productivity
- One-time $10k for API integrations

### Platform Teams

- Correlates with better fund returns
- Fastest-growing role in VC

---

## Part 8: Founder NPS Scores for VCs

### The Shocking Truth
- **Industry average NPS: 23** (below airline industry!)
- VCs claim founders are their customers but don't measure satisfaction

### What Drives High NPS
1. **Responsiveness** - Speed of responses to emails/texts
2. **Solutions-oriented** - Actually helping with intros, recruiting
3. **Specificity** - Not generic advice

### Top Performers
- Notion VC: 80+ NPS
- Forum Ventures: 70.2 NPS
- Malpani Ventures: 46 NPS (targeting 50+)

## Part 9: The Opportunity Matrix

### HIGH VALUE + UNDERSERVED

| Pain Point | Current Solutions | Gap |
|------------|-------------------|-----|
| IC Memo Creation | Manual + ChatGPT | No purpose-built VC tool |
| Institutional Memory | Notion (not purpose-built) | Knowledge leaves with partners |
| Anti-Portfolio Analysis | Spreadsheets | No pattern learning |
| Market Map Automation | PitchBook (expensive), manual | Time-intensive, obsolete fast |

### HIGH VALUE + SERVED (Hard to Compete)

| Pain Point | Market Leader | Their Moat |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| Deal Sourcing Data | PitchBook, Grata | Massive datasets, Datasite owns Grata |
| Document Analysis | Hebbia, AlphaSense | $130M+ raised, 30% of asset managers |
| VC CRM | Affinity, 4Degrees | Relationship graph data |

## Part 10: Key Insights for AlphaIntel

### The $300/Month Question

**Would VCs pay $300/month for AlphaIntel?**

Based on research:
- Yes, IF it solves a real pain point better than alternatives
- $300/month = $3,600/year = below Attio, well below Affinity
- Emerging managers have budget constraints ($3.8k/seat for data)

### What They'd Pay $300/Month For:
1. **Time savings** on repetitive tasks (IC memos, market maps)
2. **Institutional memory** that doesn't leave with partners
3. **Proactive intelligence** ("you met this founder 2 years ago")
4. **LP reporting automation** that looks professional

### What They WON'T Pay $300/Month For:
1. "A smart folder" (too generic)
2. Another knowledge base (Notion exists, is better)
3. Basic search (PitchBook/Tracxn already do this)
4. Anything that requires manual data entry

### The Wedge Opportunity
- **Emerging managers** (Fund I-III) have pain but can't afford DealCloud/Hebbia
- They need: CRM + Portfolio Monitoring + LP Reporting + Knowledge Base
- Current stack: Notion + Airtable + Spreadsheets + Manual labor
- Consolidation opportunity at $300-500/month

---

## Part 11: Recommended Next Steps

### Before Writing More Code:

1. **Validate with 10 VC Associates**
   - They do the actual work
   - Ask: "Walk me through preparing for an IC meeting"
   - Listen for pain, not features

2. **Study Hebbia's Positioning**
   - They don't sell "AI document analysis"
   - They sell "90% time savings on due diligence"
   - Value = time saved × hourly cost

3. **Find Your Wedge**
   - Can't out-Hebbia Hebbia (they have $130M+)
   - Can't out-PitchBook PitchBook (they have 18k customers)
   - Find the gap they ignore (emerging managers? specific workflow?)

4. **Build for Deployment, Not Demo**
   - VCs evaluate 101 companies for every investment
   - AlphaIntel should show, not tell
   - "Here's what we found about your portfolio company competitors"

## Part 13: The "Ralph Wiggum" Bottom Line

### What We Learned (Simply):

1. **The market is real**: VCs spend $505k/year on DealCloud, $25-40k/year on PitchBook
2. **Pain is real**: 118 hours per deal, 80% LP reporting fatigue, 42% knowledge loss
3. **Competition is real**: Hebbia has $130M+, AlphaSense keeps acquiring everything
4. **The gap is real**: 95% use software NOT built for VCs

### But Here's the Problem:

1. **AlphaIntel has no customers yet**
2. **No validation that VCs want THIS specific product**
3. **"AI Knowledge Base" is generic** - what specific workflow does it solve?
4. **Emerging managers have budget constraints** but enterprise has money

### The Only Question That Matters:

> "Which specific VC workflow takes 10+ hours/week that AlphaIntel can reduce to 1 hour?"

**Possible answers based on research:**
- IC memo preparation (days → hours with AI)
- Market map creation (days/weeks → hours)
- Portfolio company updates collection (months → weeks)
- Reference call preparation (10-20 calls per deal)
- Anti-portfolio pattern analysis (nobody does this well)

### Next Action:

**STOP BUILDING. START CALLING.**

Call 10 VC associates this week. Ask:
1. "What takes you the longest each week?"
2. "Show me how you prepare for an IC meeting"
3. "How do you know if you've seen a company before?"
4. "What tools do you wish existed?"

Then build ONLY what they ask for.
