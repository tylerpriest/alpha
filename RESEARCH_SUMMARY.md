## The Formula That Works

```
NARROW NICHE + SPECIFIC PROBLEM + OUTCOME-BASED PRICING = Revenue
```

## The 4-Week Test

1. **Week 1**: Landing page + price visible
2. **Week 2**: Get 10 people to pay
3. **Week 3**: Deliver manually, collect feedback
4. **Week 4**: If 7/10 repeat → you have a business

## The Core Insight

> "Software is the means. Service is the wedge."

Start with productized service, add software to increase margins.

## What NOT To Do

- Don't build "platforms" requiring network effects
- Don't compete head-on with $100M+ funded players
- Don't rely on freemium (1-2% conversion)
- Don't do enterprise sales with limited runway

## What TO Do

- Pick boring, underserved industries
- Charge per deliverable, not per seat
- Deliver manually first, automate later
- Get money exchanged before building features

1. **Pick ONE** from Top 10 list
2. **Build landing page** with price
3. **Get first payment** this week
4. **Deliver manually** to first customers
5. **Learn what they really need**
